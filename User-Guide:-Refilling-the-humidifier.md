Over the course of an experiment it is expected that you will need to refill the humidifier several times. The humidifier will trigger a warning that will be displayed in the olympus interface. It will also turn on the error LED (yellow one) on. This will happen 12 to 18h before reaching the critical level, where the humidifier will be turned off.


To refill please follow these steps:

1. Unplug the power plug of the Celaeno board.
2. Unplug the CAN cable
3. Unplug the humidifier output (40mm flexible tube)
4. Using a funnel, refill the humidifier with deionized water. Tap water may damage the piezo transducer that produces mist. Take care not to overfill the humidifier as water may spill through the side mounting screws of the float sensor holder.
5. Check carefully that no water was spilled on the electronics. If so you will need to unmount the acrylic cover and dry it gently with an air drier.
6. Plug back the sinkhole.
7. Plug back the CAN cable.
8. Plug back the Power


During this procedure the olympus will report a missing Celaeno error as the board need to be disconnected. A few seconds after the board is reconnected, the error will be cleared, and everything will come back to normal.
