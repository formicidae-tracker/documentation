A list with what we need to mention about working with electronics at some point:

- Wait at least 30 minutes after switching off the tracking experiment before
unplugging the light board due to the capacitors.

Referring to the UNIL tracking setup
- There are two power groups in the new tracking room (9.1 an 9.2). 9.2 is the
supply for the tracking hosts and the boxes. This group is therefore reserved
and should not be used for other electronic equipment. Group 9.1 is free to be
used for other purposes, such as the soldering station or a vacuum cleaner.
